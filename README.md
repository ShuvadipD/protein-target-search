This repository contains simulation codes and plot data for studying how proteins search for target sites on folded chromatin. By combining coarse-grained polymer models with Hi-C-informed contact networks, the simulations investigate how chromatin folding patterns—such as topologically associating domains (TADs) and long-range loops—influence the efficiency and dynamics of protein search.

## Repository Structure

- **`Plot_data/`** – Source data files for key figures.  
- **`polymer_simulation/`** – LAMMPS input scripts for polymer simulations.  
- **`code_for_mfpt/`** – C code to calculate mean first-passage time (MFPT) on a network.

## Requirements

- [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/)
- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
